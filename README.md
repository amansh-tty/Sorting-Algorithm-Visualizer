# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

A Python project that visualizes various sorting algorithms using Pygame. This application demonstrates the workings of Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort through animated visualizations.

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms.
- Interactive interface to select and visualize different sorting methods.
- Animated sorting process to better understand how each algorithm works.
